## Question 2

**How can you use B = MAP to make making new habits easier? What are M,
A and P?**

**Answer:**
If the task is too hard then you will require a higher level of
motivation in order to do that task.
Shrink the new habit to the tiniest version so that you require very low
motivation to do it.
Either reduce the quantity or just do the first step.
Use action prompts --- after completion of the existing habit task
introduce a new tiny habit task.
Tiny habits take ≤ 30 seconds.
Always celebrate the completion of a tiny habit.

Behavior = Motivation × Ability × Prompt

Always celebrate completion of a tiny habit. It boosts motivation and
helps you build tiny habits consistently.
