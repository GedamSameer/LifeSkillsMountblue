# Communication & Listening Reflection

## Question 1  
### What are the steps/strategies to do Active Listening?

1. Avoid getting distracted by your own thoughts. Stay fully focused on the speaker and the topic.
2. Do not interrupt the speaker. Let them complete their point before responding.
3. Use “door openers” such as:
   - “I see…”
   - “Tell me more…”
   - “Go on…”
4. Show active body language like nodding, maintaining eye contact, and facing the speaker.
5. Take notes during important discussions if necessary.
6. Paraphrase what the speaker said to confirm understanding and ensure clarity.

## Question 2  
### According to Fisher's model, what are the key points of Reflective Listening?

Reflective listening means carefully listening to the speaker, understanding their message, and repeating it in your own words. After repeating, you should ask if you understood it correctly or if you missed anything. This helps avoid misunderstandings and builds trust.
